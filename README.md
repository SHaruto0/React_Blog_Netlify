# React Blog

React Blog is a simple blogging application built with React.js, designed to allow users to manage blog posts. It includes basic functionality like adding, editing, and deleting posts, similar to other blogging platforms. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of React for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. It also uses JSON Server to simulate a backend API for data persistence. This project is a great starting point for learning how to handle state, forms, and API interactions in React.
